# MVVM Demo
Simple iOS app I created to demo the MVVM design pattern. It makes a request to a REST API and shows the data in a tableview with sections based on the data and a business logic.
It implements concepts of network requests to a REST API, data serialization, delegates (protocols), services, async/non-blocking programming and others.

Created using Swift, UIKit and CocoaPods.

### Packages
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)

### Architecture
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with delegate to communicate between the ViewModel and the View.
